# Quickstart: Add Map Marker

1) Install dependencies: `flutter pub get` (Flutter 3.5.4+).  
2) Run the app: `flutter run` (choose iOS/Android target).  
3) Create a marker: long-press on the map, choose **Add marker**, pick icon/color, name it, then Create.  
4) Verify persistence: restart the app; the marker should reappear with the saved icon/color/name.  
5) Cancel/back flow: start add flow, navigate back between steps, cancel before creation, and confirm no new marker appears.
