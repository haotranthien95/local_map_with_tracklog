# Specification Quality Checklist: Bottom Navigation and Live Location Tracking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: December 29, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation performed on**: December 29, 2025

### Content Quality - PASSED
✓ Specification written in user-focused language
✓ No implementation-specific details in main requirements
✓ Technical Notes section appropriately separated for optional implementation guidance
✓ All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED
✓ All 22 functional requirements are clear and testable
✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
✓ All 9 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
✓ 4 prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios defined
✓ 9 edge cases identified
✓ Scope clearly defined with explicit "Out of Scope" section
✓ Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented

### Feature Readiness - PASSED
✓ User stories map to functional requirements
✓ Each story includes independent test descriptions
✓ Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes (e.g., "within 100 milliseconds", "with a single tap")
✓ Technical Notes kept separate from core specification

## Overall Status: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, comprehensive, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

No additional clarifications or updates needed.
